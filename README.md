I have converted PSD to HTML static template. In project I mostly used flex. Fonts I have downloaded from other github projects. After that I transformed .otf fonts format in page called Fonts Squirrel. 
I have used some javascript for unchecked all inputs after click on "Clear filter" button and for hiding checkbox box. For animations I have used a library AOS. 
I have partitioned css for custom.css and responsive.css.
